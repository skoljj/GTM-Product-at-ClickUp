# Old Game / New Game — Concept Development

This directory is where we'll build the visual artifacts that make the paradigm shift explicit.

## Priority Order
1. **Equation Animation** (Concept D) — Quick win, mathematically compelling
2. **Split-Screen Divider** (Concept A) — Visceral contrast, interactive
3. **Capability Lifecycle Flowchart** (Concept E) — Process comparison, animated
4. **Two Cities** (Concept C) — 3D showpiece if time allows
5. **Evolution Timeline** (Concept B) — Historical context, horizontal scroll

See `../docs/NARRATIVE.md` for full concept descriptions and design direction.
